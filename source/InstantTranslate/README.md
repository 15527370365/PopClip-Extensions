Instant Translate
-----------------

The original Instant Translate (a.k.a. Better Translate) was developed by [harmy](http://harmy.github.io).

Some time in March/April 2015 Google changed their back end which stopped the original version from working. (To be fair to Google, the original was skirting around the paid API using some undocumented endpoints.)

This new version (21 Apr 2015) was modified from the original by [chenggiant](https://github.com/chenggiant), to use the official Microsoft Translator API.

Further modifications made by Nick Moore.

Portions of code also based on translate.py which came under the following license:

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
    # <terry.yinzhe@gmail.com> wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
    # can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
    # this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return to Terry Yin.
    #
    # The idea of this is borrowed from <mort.yao@gmail.com>'s brilliant work
    #    https://github.com/soimort/google-translate-cli
    # He uses "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE". That's why I use it too. So you can buy him a 
    # beer too.

Please note, this extension comes with a client key and client secret registered with MS Azure marketplace by me (Nick). It's good for 2 million characters a month but this will be shared between every user of the extension. Let's see how long this holds up....

You can always replace this with your own key/secret, then you get a whole 2,000,000 per month to yourself.
